            Development and Validation of Hierarchical Methodology for the Numerical
            Simulation of the Flow Field around and in the Wake of Horizontal Axis
            Wind Turbines
          </h4>
          <p>
            A hierarchy of computational methods for Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine
            (HAWT - NREL Phase VI) flow field is proposed, focusing on rotor models for Reynolds-
            Averaged Navier-Stokes (RNS) simulations. Three models are
            systematically compared to determine their adequacy to capture performance
            and wake dynamics, and the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
            The Moving Reference Frame (MRF) model is prescribed for detailed flow
            field studies, specifically at the root and blade tip. The Blade Element
            Model (BEM) does not reproduce the near wake region but successfully
            predicts the velocity deficit in the axisymmetric far wake, and the power
            and torque coefficients. The Actuator Disk Model (ADM) underestimates
            the velocity deficit in the far wake, but can be corrected to perform
            simulations of large wind farms. This methodology is applied to a canonical
            rotor and compared against experimental data. These models span three
            orders of magnitude in computational time and cost for the study of
            HAWT aerodynamic performance and wake interaction.

          <p>
            This work is an experimental/numerical study of a full- and lab.-scale
            Horizontal Axis Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) Turbine. The full-scale turbine is called
            the DOE Reference Model 1 (DOE RM1), which is a refrence MHK turbine model developed
            and published at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in US. The lab.-scale
            model turbine is re-designed based on
            the DOE RM1, with a modified geometry to reproduce performance at the flume scale
            Reynolds numbers. These modifications were necessary to overcome the strong Reynolds
            number effect on the NACA 6 airfoil family used on the design, and therefore on the
            device performance in experimental analysis. The performance and wake structure of
            a the lab.-scale model was analyzed with measurements
            conducted on a 45:1 scale physical model of the modified design of the DOE RM1 rotor.
            The details of the rotor flow field and wake evolution are analyzed from numerical
            solution of the RANS equations solved around a computational model of both the full-
            and lab.-scale models turbine.
            A comparison between the experimental and numerical results is presented.
            These comparisons highlight the strengths as well as limitations of the experimental
            and numerical analysis for these types of MHK turbine characterizations. On a more general
            sense, these comparisons provide useful guidelines for developing a set of experimental
            flume scale data and to use it to validate numerical tools, and as pilot projects
            start to go in the water in the US, to perform a similar type of analysis and design
            validation of full scale devices.

            Numerical characterization of Horizontal Axis Hydrokinetic Turbines Array

          <p>
            Hydrokinetic turbines, similarly to wind turbines, should be placed in
            the form of an array to have the potential for electricity production
            necessary to connect to the electrical grid and feed it at a commercial scale.
            Due to the confined nature of tidal sites, however, the spacing of turbines
            in an array of Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) turbines is much more critical to
            the energy production and economic viability of the turbine farm than in
            wind energy installations, and needs to be highly optimized. This optimization
            process must maximize the efficiency of power generation while minimizing the
            capital cost of the infrastructure, the potential environmental effects of the
            array and the fatigue load on the turbines' structure. The initial step to
            perform this optimization process is to understand the flow field in the array
            and how the devices perform while interacting with this complex velocity field.
            This initial step also provides an in-depth understanding of the potential
            constraints for the array optimization process. A numerical methodology
            can then be developed to model the essential physics of the flow field needed
            for the array computations, in an time-efficient way compatible with the
            optimization of turbine array performance. This numerical methodology can
            be used to examine the effect of various constraints in this optimization
            process, such as the number of turbines per surface area, the number of
            turbine rows, ... .
            </br>
            In this part of my research the Blade Element Model (BEM), one of the models
            from the previously developed methodology in the context of the characterization
            of a single MHK turbine, is used for the flow field simulation in an array of
            turbines. The BEM of several turbines in different spatial configurations and
            operating at different set points is implemented to match experimental conditions
            in two- and three-turbine arrays in a research flume. The goal of this process
            is to further validate the application of the BEM model to turbine wake and
            performance characterization in an array.

          <p>
            Simulation of heavy particles or sediment in turbulent flows has practical use in
            fields of industrial and environmental Multiphase Flows. These simulations rely
            on numerical models to simulate the interaction of these particles with turbulent eddies.
            The Discrete Random Walk (DRW) model is commonly used for simulation of particle dispersion
            in various turbulent flow fields and applications, such as interaction of particles with
            wake of a Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) turbines. The previous studies confirmed and reported
            that there are still sources of uncertainty in the use of the DRW model in conjunction with
            RANS simulations of the turbulent carrier flow. One of the key issues for the DRW model
            in various applications is to determine the characteristic eddy lifetime scale, which
            controls the length of time over which a particle interacts with an eddy in the turbulent flow.
            We develop a simple methodology, based on G.I. Taylor’s classical dispersion theory, for
            determination of the characteristic eddy lifetime value required in the engineering predictions
            of particle transport for which detailed experimental data is not available. We experimentally
            validated our methodology and then applied it to a novel ocean engineering problem for which
            experimental data is lacking over a wide range of param- eters: transport of suspended sediment
            in a high Reynolds number channel flow with a MHK Turbine.

            Investigation on Potential Environmental Effect of

          </h4>
          <p>
            In this paert of my research, the calibrated Discrete Random Walk (DRW)
            model is coupled with the RANS model, which provides the simulated flow
            field around and in the wake of the Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) turbine (modeled via BEM)
            in the channel. The DRW model uses the RANS velocity field and turbulence variables to
            simulate the trajectory of particles in the flow field. The goal of this modeling is to
            understand the effect of the HAHT wake on the sedimentation process of suspended
            particles in the tidal channel.
            </br>
            These injected particles travel along the channel and interact with the velocity
            deficit in the turbine wake and the accelerated flow around the blades. The decelerated
            and accelerated flows affect the particle paths and the overall sedimentation process.
            In order to investigate the effect of the turbine wake on the sedimentation of the
            modeled particles, each of the particles is tracked from their initial injection position
            at the inlet as it is convected and sediments towards the bottom of the tidal channel.
            The sedimentation of particles with different Stokes number (i.e. sizes) in a channel
            with and without MHK turbine effect was compared against each other to reveals
            physics behind the MHK turbine-sedimentaion interaction.
